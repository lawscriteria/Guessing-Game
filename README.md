# Guessing Game

#### Description: The Guessing Game is a Python project that demonstrates a collection of search algorithms through an interactive game. In this game, the program acts as the guesser, and the user selects a number within a given range. The user also specifies the preferred strategy or "play" that the program should use to find and "guess" the hidden number.

### You cannot lie in this game. 

## How to Play: 

1) #### Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. 
    [Click here to install Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Set Up: Once Python is installed, follow these steps:
    - #### Open your code editor or IDE
        If you do not have a code editor, you'll have to download one. Popular IDEs include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). Install and open your code editor of preference.
    - #### Open the Project File
        Open the file *guessing_game.py* within the *guessing_game* folder you downloaded. Note that it is a *.zip* file, so you will need to extract it using a *zip file manager*.
    - #### Run the Python File
        After opening the .py file in your code editor, run it.
        
    **Disclaimer: The program runs entirely within the text editor's terminal.**

## Search Algorithms

Currect search algorithms include:

    let R = { x ‚à£ a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b} ùëõ ‚àà ùëÖ

#### (1) Binary search [B(n, R)]: Utilizes a half-interval search; during each iteration, it will chop or halve the given set R and check each new half r for n. This is repeated until n is found.

Average time complexity: O(log N)

#### (2) Random search [E(n, R)]: Uses purely random integer choices or guesses within the given range of set R. If the guess is incorrect, the program treats it as a point for the division of set R into two new sets. Then the program will check each new set r for n, and it will repeat the process on the new set r with n in it until n is found.

Average-case time complexity: O(N)

#### (3) Quarter Slice [Q(n, R)]: Chops or slices the given set R into two new sets one with a length 1/4 of that of R, and the other with a length 3/4 of that of R, and checks for n in each new set r. Repeats the process on the new set r with n in it until n is found.

Average time complexity: O(log N)
