# Guessing Game

#### Description: The Guessing Game is a Python project that demonstrates a collection of search algorithms through an interactive game. In this game, the program acts as the guesser, and the user selects a number within a given range. The user also specifies the preferred strategy or "play" that the program should use to find and "guess" the hidden number.

### You cannot lie in this game. 

## How to Play: 

1) #### Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. 
    [Click here to install Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Set Up: Once Python is installed, follow these steps:
    - #### Open your code editor or IDE
        If you do not have a code editor, you'll have to download one. Popular IDEs include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). Install and open your code editor of preference.
    - #### Open the Project File
        Open the file *guessing_game.py* within the *guessing_game* folder you downloaded. Note that it is a *.zip* file, so you will need to extract it using a *zip file manager*.
    - #### Run the Python File
        After opening the .py file in your code editor, run it.
        
    **Disclaimer: The program runs entirely within the text editor's terminal.**

## Search Algorithms

Current search algorithms are:

    let R = { x ‚à£ a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b} ùëõ ‚àà ùëÖ

#### (1) Binary search [B(n, R)]: Utilizes a half-interval search; during each iteration, it will chop or halve the given set R and check if the midpoint is equal to n by asking the user. If it is not, the user has to specify whether n is lesser than or greater than the midpoint. This process is repeated for the new set r with n in it until n is found.

Average time complexity: O(log N)

#### (2) Random search [E(n, R)]: Uses purely random integer choices or guesses within the given range of set R. If the guess is incorrect, the user specifies whether it is lesser than or greater than n. This process is repeated for the new set r with n in it until n is found.

Average-case time complexity: O(N)

#### (3) Quarter Slice [Q(n, R)]: Chops or slices the given set R into two new sets one with a length 1/4 of that of R, and the other with a length 3/4 of that of R, and checks if the number used as the division point is equal to n. If not, the user has to give a comparison for n, and just like the previous methods, this information is used to define new smaller sets r with n in them, and the process is repeated until n is found.

Average time complexity: O(log N)
